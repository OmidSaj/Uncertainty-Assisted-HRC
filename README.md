# Uncertainty-Assisted Image-Processing for Human-Robot Close Collaboration
This is the official repository for the code and models in the IEEE paper. At this time, a demo of the proposed uncertainty-assisted framework on the [EgoHands](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/projects/egohands/) test set is presented. You might use the compressed test images and masks in .npz format from the release section [here](). The HRC dataset and models will be released soon.
